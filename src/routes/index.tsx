        <h2>A Look Back on the Common School Movement </h2>
        The Common School Movement was a reform movement with the goal of
        providing an equal opportunity for education to all. The movement
        started in the 19th century, and planned to create a state funded school
        system. In the early days of the movement, most common schools were
        funded through a mixture of local public funds and tuition paid by its
        students. The new emphasis on public education was largely contributed
        to by the Market Revolution, which encouraged competition and
        selfishness. Goods were now being produced in factories for the use of
        many, rather than being produced by individual families, who used the
        goods themselves or sold them to a few local customers. This prevalence
        of market capitalism caused schools to develop, in order to give the
        youth of the new generations the opportunity to participate in the
        world’s interconnected economy. Another factor that contributed to the
        common school movement was that many states had given all white males
        the right to vote, which caused the percentage of people who could vote
        to increase drastically. In response to this, the schools developed
        their education further, in order to educate the potential voters of the
        future. By the 1830s, reformers were advocating for a common school
        system, regulated and controlled by the state. They wanted the state to
        be able to control the curriculum, the qualification of teachers, and
        the length of the school year. The reformers believed that everyone
        should pay for the common schools equally, because an educated youth
        would enrich the society as a whole. By the 1860s —after much opposition
        from Catholics who opposed the protestant influence of the schools, and
        wealthy Americans who sent their children to privately funded schools
        and did not feel it was necessary to support and fund the education of
        those who could not afford a private education— the majority of Northern
        states had adopted a fully publicly funded school system. However, it
        would take until the end of the century for the entire country to have
        fully publicly funded schools, as the schools in most southern states
        still required tuition to cover some of the cost. The curriculum of
        these schools was not meant to prepare students for any specific career
        or job, but rather to simply give them a general education applicable to
        many different paths. Children were taught how to do basic arithmetic,
        read, and write. The school system increased the literacy rate among the
        white adult population to around 90 percent in the middle of the 19th
        century, which was similar to the rate of literacy in Europe. More men
        than women could read, because of the lack of equal education for males
        and females. This was due to the assumption that men would have more
        societal roles to fulfill than women, who were expected to stay within
        the home. In order to create more variation in the subjects that
        children were being taught, public high schools were established. These
        high schools provided students with schooling in areas such as
        mathematics, history, logic, sciences, English composition and
        literature, and moral philosophy. When they were first established,
        these schools were only open to boys, as their sole purpose was to
        prepare them for a career. By the end of the 19th century, there were
        more than 2,500 public high schools which educated more than 200,000
        students at a time. Public high schools became open to girls in the late
        1800s, and by the year 1900, the majority of high school students were
        girls. The high schools had “tracks,” which were different sets of
        courses tailored to students depending on their future career prospects.
        The public common schools and high schools allowed families to move up
        through the social and economic hierarchy through the money their
        children were making, due to their careers achieved through public
        education. This caused American society to become more oriented towards
        education, as more people realized that it was the path to success.
        <h2>Horace Mann</h2>
        <p>
          Horace Mann died yesterday, August 2, at age 63. This is a look back
          at his important life as a supporter of the common school.
        </p>
        <h3>Early Life</h3>
        <p>
          Horace Mann was born on May 4, 1796 in Franklin, Massachusetts. He
          grew up in poverty, his father being a farmer who died when Mann was
          13. This meant that Mann had to work from a very young age, and he had
          to work hard, which gave him the work ethic that he kept until he was
          older, not complaining about hard work. Spending so much time and then
          still not getting very much money meant that he never got that good of
          an education, only receiving the common 10 weeks a year that rural
          schools were open for. Mann sought out education eagerly, eventually
          being tutored by Samuel Barrett, who was an itinerant teacher at the
          time, but later became a leading Unitarian minister. From Samuel
          Barrett he learned to read, write, and speak both Latin and Greek
          fluently, which was a requirement to get into a university. He wasn’t
          able to get enough money to apply until he was 20, at which point he
          traveled to take Brown University’s oral entrance exams. Mann did well
          enough that he got in and was even able to skip Freshman year, so he
          started his higher education in 1816 in the Sophomore class.
        </p>
        <h3>Higher Education</h3>
        <p>
          Horace Mann continued to be eager with his education in university,
          seeking out any extra opportunities to gain knowledge. During
          university was also when he first got ideas about education reform.
          During the 8 week winter break, when it was assumed that students
          would work to get enough money to pay for a second semester of
          schooling, Mann followed most others in teaching at a rural winter
          school, the same kind of place that Mann had previously been educated
          at before he was privately tutored. While teaching, he realized how
          poorly funded these lower education schools were, which started his
          ideas of reform. Mann graduated as a valedictorian after only 3 years
          in university, after which he accepted a teaching post for 2 years at
          Brown. Mann then went to specifically study law at Litchfield Law
          School, and then returned to Massachusetts, where he grew up, to study
          law in Dedham. In Dedham, he spoke at the Independence Day
          celebrations for three years until 1826, when John Adams and Thomas
          Jefferson died on the same day. It was at his eulogy for them that
          Mann met John Quincy Adams, whom he soon became lifelong friends with
          after Adams saw him speak. Adams convinced Mann to stop practicing law
          and instead serve the country and become a politician.
        </p>
        <h3>Political Life</h3>
        <p>
          Horace Mann successfully ran for the Massachusetts House of
          Representatives in 1827. He started his political career strongly,
          arguing against and eventually abolishing the right of states to make
          donations to local churches, saying that it went against the idea of
          freedom of religion. Mann continued his politics, arguing mainly for
          societal issues, such as preventing hangings for smaller crimes and
          ending imprisonment of insane people. In 1835, Mann won a
          Massachusetts senate seat as a Republican, though soon after the Whig
          party was formed, so when Mann ran for re-election in two years, he
          ran as a Whig. This time, the senate named him chairman of the senate.
          With this new power, he turned to an issue that he found even more
          important: education. Mann believed, along with others, that it was
          important for children to be able to get an education instead of going
          out to work from a young age. Supporters of the movement included
          industrialists who believed that an education would make their workers
          more productive and many families who would benefit from having more
          educated children. There were also, however, many people against the
          movement. There were many reasons to be against the movement, such as
          being wealthy, not wanting to pay for others to get an education when
          their children would go to a private school anyway, or being a
          business owner such as an industrialist or farmer who didn’t want to
          lose their child labor or have a more educated working class that
          would be more reluctant to do manual labor. Many families didn’t want
          to lose the income that the children made. The Congressional Church
          also fought the movement, as the common schools often taught more
          protestant views. Some fought common education for girls on the idea
          that it would make women less willing to be subservient wives and
          mothers. One key supporter of the education reform movement was Edward
          Everett, a close friend of Mann who got elected to Massachusetts
          governor in 1836. Mann and Everett led the way to passing the nation’s
          first law regulating child labor and education. While not completely
          stopping child labor, it banned the employment of any child under 15
          with less than three months of education the previous year. This meant
          that although most kids would still be working, they would also need
          to get an education. Along with this, Everett established the first
          board of education, asking Mann to be the secretary of the board in
          1837. Others around Mann warned him of giving up a promising career in
          law-being on track to become president-to fully pursue education
          reform, but in the end he thought it would be more valuable to future
          people if he fought for education reform.
        </p>
        <h3>The Process of Education Reform</h3>
        <p>
          After being named secretary of the first board of education in
          Massachusetts, Horace Mann set out on a campaign to get people to
          support education reform. At first, he tried to warn of the dangers of
          having so many uneducated people. After this didn’t work, he tried
          appealing to selfish interests. He pointed out how well educated
          people could do work more efficiently, as well as how more educated
          people could bring in more money. At the end of this campaign, he
          raised more than $2 million to build public schools, including 50 high
          schools. The minimum school year to be able to work was also raised to
          six months, effectively doubling childrens’ education. Mann then found
          funding to build America’s first teachers college to be able to get
          better teachers in Lexington, Massachusetts. After this was a site of
          national and even international attention, he went around
          Massachusetts again, convincing more communities to establish public
          common schools as well as getting the funding to build three more
          teachers colleges. One of the most famous parts of the common school
          movement is The Common School Journal, which Mann founded and edited
          in 1838. This held Mann’s ideas about education, as well as sample
          lessons for different subjects. Throughout the journal, Mann pioneered
          concepts of how schools should work, including grading of children’s
          work and the idea of a recess for younger kids. This journal was very
          widely read, being sent to teachers across America. Mann eventually
          went to other states, spreading ideas of education reform. In Boston,
          Elizabeth and Mary Peabody heavily supported Mann’s efforts, and after
          six years of the campaign, Mann married Mary Peabody on May 1, 1843,
          in Boston. Mary eventually took over writing The Common School
          Journal. Mann continued advocating for education reform, winning a two
          year controversy over flogging children, but he got hooked back into
          national politics again when he was called on to fill John Quincy
          Adams’ spot after he died in 1848.
        </p>
        <h3>Late Life</h3>
        <p>
          When Horace Mann returned to national politics, he found it in a
          turmoil. The battle between the North and South over slavery was
          raging on, and they were often meeting in the middle in Washington.
          Mann was a strong opponent of slavery, speaking out against it, saying
          that civil war would be better than having slavery continue. His stint
          in Washington was less successful than in Massachusetts, however, and
          so when a new Fugative Slave Law was passed in 1850, he brought his
          wife and children to live with him in Washington, and then returned
          home to a more familar place, working for education reform. While he
          was approached by many colleges, Mann jumped at the concept of Antioch
          College in Ohio, which was proposed to allow for completely equal
          education for all. not being dependent on wealth, race, or gender.
          While others wanted him to run for national politics, including the
          president, Mann happily developed Antioch into a model for
          universities around the nation and the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mann died yesterday at the age of 63, six years after Antioch’s
          founding.
